# playpro

PlayPro was conceived as an MVP with the intention of aiding schools in organizing e-sports tournaments. It aimed to offer a platform where students could compete in a structured, competitive environment, enhanced with features like live leaderboards, an in-app waiting room chat, among others, to enrich the user experience.

The project, however, was halted before reaching the phase of a live release.
